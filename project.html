        <p>The competition definitely lacks no features but you have to constantly work to find where they are and what they mean. Is this the experience we want for our users? Or more importantly, <span style="color:#FFC823; font-weight: 600;"><em>who</em></span> are our users?</p>

        <h3 class = "process-steps"><span class = "yellow">4.</span> User Stories</h3>
        <p>With our personas in mind, I created a list of common use cases in the form of user stories. Every story tells of a mini journey but not all stories are born equal. Thus, I categorize task by priority and user type.</p>

        <table class="mobile">

        <p>The app is one big system made of little systems that talk to each other. Drafting the logical flow between action and result is the first step to architecting an effective experience.</p>

        <h3 class = "process-steps"><span class = "yellow">6.</span> Wireframes</h3>
        <p>User flows are fleshed out through wireframes to get a sense of a real world product. I start on paper, go through numerous versions, annotate, and repeat until the user flows are satisfied.</p>

        <div class="carousel-container">
          <p class="carousel-title">&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Then, I draft Lo-Fi wireframes on Balsamiq because my handwriting is that of a young child (or a doctor… you decide). Also to stay focused on content strategy.</p>

        <h4 class ="chart-title">What <span class = "high">Didn't</span></h4>
        <p>When presented with two buttons, the users naturally click the bigger or bottom-most button without reading the text. Having two buttons creates a tension between options. In the login page, some users blindly clicked the “create account” button rather than “login.”</p>

        <p>In the Hi-Fi stage, the primary page action was kept as a button and revealed after fillout. The Login button reveals on password fillout to grab the users attention with only one option. The secondary action (creating an account) was changed to a link and moved away from the visual path.</p>
        <img src="images/user-test-1/signup2.png" class="single-img">
        <p>Users don’t want to have to think about every action. Little breadcrumbs can steer users to confusion or success. Laying the right path determines that success.</p>

        <h4 class = "chart-title">What <span class = "low">Worked</span></h4>
        <p>Users were able to easily navigate, manage files, invite members to groups, find file details and version history.</p>
        <h4 class ="chart-title">What <span class = "high">Didn't</span></h4>
        <p>The Sign up process was 3 steps, which was 2 steps too many. Users just wanted to click and go, thus it was made to be.</p>

        <p>Some users were confused with the “Group” action (creating new Groups or Folders). Some users associated the “new” button with files and folders, not new groups. Another user confused the “create folder” button with the “upload folder” button.</p>
        <p><br>Thus, I removed the “Group” category and moved the “Create Group” button to the Social button in the navigation bar. I also moved the “Create New Folder” button to the “Create” category.</p>

        <p>Reducing three categories to two reduces the cognitive load required to navigate. I added visual aids such as coloring and icons further differentiate the options.</p>
        <p><br>In a preference test, 57% users preferred the second button layout with “...” button closer to screen center, and the star button left of the file name. The layout was changed based on proximity with relevant actions.</p>

        <p>I wanted my users to feel personally connected and at peace. Mixing colorful personalities with the concept of cloud, I looked to the aurora borealis for natural inspiration. An array of green, violet, and red light particles glowing in the sky brings a sense of calming awe and wonder to everyone looking up from it’s horizon.</p>
        <img src="images/branding/ideas.png" class="single-img">
        <p>Brainstorming around a few concepts such as sky, light, color - elements of an aurora borealis. “Skylake” worked well phonetically and supplemented the borealis element.</p>
        <img src="images/branding/logo-final.png" class="single-img">
        <p>The mountain is the origin of a single long stroke which ends openly to represent continuity or the infinite. Cloud has a sense of vastness and freedom that allows the user to connect within a single medium. I wanted to accentuate the mountain and aurora so I circled the logo and used negative space.</p>

          <h4 class ="conc-title">Process</h4>
          <p>An iterative and rigorous design process encourages a robust final product. In conjunction, flexibility and balance of time and effort is the managerial counterpart to process - equally as important to success as future projects will have unpredictable constraints or schedules.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "conclusions">
          <img src="styles/icons/feedback.svg" class="conc-icon">
          <h4 class ="conc-title">Feedback</h4>
          <p>User Feedback is absolutely crucial. I wasn’t too sure that there was space for another cloud app but the user survey revealed real problems that needed solutions. Remaining unbiased is difficult. Thankfully, prototyping and testing reveals all the cracks in both form and function.</p>

          <img src="styles/icons/visual.svg" class="conc-icon">
          <h4 class ="conc-title">Visual</h4>
          <p>Visual communication is a delicate art with no one true answer. The method needs to fit into context of each situation and action. A brand needs character and meaning, not just pretty face. But it all starts with a sketch, the first-fruit of creation.</p>
