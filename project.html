        <p>I conducted a user survey which revealed two main competitors - Google Drive (94% of users) and Dropbox (41% of users). They’re doing something right, but a closer look reveals some poor UI decisions that frustrate users.</p>

        <!-- Flickity HTML init -->

        <p>The competition definitely lacks no features but you have to constantly work to find where they are and what they mean. Is this the experience we want for our users? Or more importantly, <span style="color:#FFC823"><em>who</em></span> are our users?</p>

        <h3 class = "process-steps"><span class = "yellow">4.</span> User Stories</h3>
        <p>With our personas in mind, I created a list of common use cases in the form of user stories. Every story tells of a mini journey but not all stories are born equal. Thus, I categorize task by priority and user type.</p>
        <table>

        <p>Priority dictates hierarchy, architecture, flow, and visual design. A minimum viable product is the initial goal so users first get what they need, then add nice-to-haves in succession. </p>

        <h4>What <span class = "worked">Worked</span></h4>

        <h4>What <span class = "didnotwork">Didn't</span></h4>
        <p>When presented with two buttons, the users naturally click the bigger or bottom-most button without reading the text. Having two buttons creates a tension between options. In the login page, some users blindly clicked the “create account” button rather than “login.”</p>
        <img src="#">
        <p>In the Hi-Fi stage, the primary page action was kept as a button and revealed after fillout. The Login button reveals on password fillout to grab the users attention with only one option. The secondary action (creating an account) was changed to a link and moved away from the visual path.</p>
        <img src="#">
        <p>Users don’t want to have to think about every action. Little breadcrumbs can steer users to confusion or success. Laying the right path determines that success.</p>

        <p>Some users were confused with the “Group” action (creating new Groups or Folders). Some users associated the “new” button with files and folders, not new groups. Another user confused the “create folder” button with the “upload folder” button.</p>

        <p>Thus, I removed the “Group” category and moved the “Create Group” button to the Social button in the navigation bar. I also moved the “Create New Folder” button to the “Create” category.</p>
        <img src="#">
        <img src="#">
        <p>Reducing three categories to two reduces the cognitive load required to navigate. I added visual aids such as coloring and icons further differentiate the options.</p>
        <p>In a preference test, 57% users preferred the second button layout with “...” button closer to screen center, and the star button left of the file name. The layout was changed based on proximity with relevant actions.</p>

        <p>I wanted my users to feel personally connected and at peace. Mixing colorful personalities with the concept of cloud, I looked to the aurora borealis for natural inspiration. An array of green, violet, and red light particles glowing in the sky brings a sense of calming awe and wonder to everyone looking up from it’s horizon.</p>

        <img src="#">
        <p>The mountain is the origin of a single long stroke which ends openly to represent continuity or the infinite. Cloud has a sense of vastness and freedom that allows the user to connect within a single medium. I wanted to accentuate the mountain and aurora so I circled the logo and used negative space.</p>
