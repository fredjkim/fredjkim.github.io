        <p>Users were able to create, organize, and share files with no issues. Navigation was quick and easy for the users.</p>
        <h4 class ="chart-title thousand">What Didn't</h4>
        <p>When presented with two buttons, the users naturally click the bigger or bottom-most button without reading the text. Having two buttons creates a tension between options. In the login page, some users blindly clicked the “create account” button rather than “login.”</p>

        <p>In the Hi-Fi stage, the primary page action was kept as a button and revealed after fillout. The Login button reveals on password fillout to grab the users attention with only one option. The secondary action (creating an account) was changed to a link and moved away from the visual path. Users don’t want to have to think about every action. Little breadcrumbs can steer users to confusion or success. Laying the right path determines that success.</p>

        <p>Some users were confused with the “Group” action (creating new Groups or Folders). Some users associated the “new” button with files and folders, not new groups. Another user confused the “create folder” button with the “upload folder” button.</p>

        <p>I aimed to capture colorful personalities blended into the concept of cloud. I brainstormed around concepts such as sky, light, and color until I came to the aurora borealis for natural inspiration. Glowing particles flow through the sky like a river or lake in the sky. The name “Skylake” was phonetically smooth and captured the borealis and social elements.</p>

        <p>The mountain is the origin of a single long stroke which ends openly to represent continuity or the infinite. Cloud has a sense of vastness and freedom that allows the user to connect within a single medium. I wanted to accentuate the mountain and aurora so I circled the logo and used negative space.</p>
